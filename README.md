Azure with Microservices practice plan for 4 weeks:
===================================================

#Week 1: Introduction to Microservices

Day 1: What are Microservices?
Read about microservices architecture, its benefits, and challenges.
Resources: Articles and videos on sites like Martin Fowler’s blog or YouTube.

Day 2: Monolith vs. Microservices
Understand the differences. Why would we move from monolithic to microservices?
Practice: Diagram a simple monolithic application and how it would be broken down into microservices.

Day 3: Microservices Principles
Learn about the principles of microservices: decentralized data management, API-first design, etc.
Resource: Read the book "Building Microservices" by Sam Newman.

Day 4: RESTful API Design
Learn how to design RESTful APIs, covering HTTP methods, status codes, and resource naming conventions.
Practice: Design a sample API for a simple service (e.g., user management).

Day 5: Tools and Technologies
Explore the common tools and frameworks used in microservices (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, API Gateways).
Resource: Watch introductory videos on Docker and Kubernetes.

Day 6: Introduction to Azure
Set up an Azure account (free tier) and familiarize yourself with the Azure portal.
Resource: Azure documentation.

Day 7: Azure Services Overview
Learn about Azure services related to microservices: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Functions, Azure App Service, Azure API Management.
Practice: Explore Azure documentation for each service.

#Week 2: Building Microservices

Day 8: ASP.NET Core Basics
Learn how to build a basic ASP.NET Core Web API application.
Resource: Microsoft’s documentation and tutorials.

Day 9: Creating Your First Microservice
Create a simple .NET Core Web API as a microservice (e.g., a Product service).
Practice: Use a sample database (SQL Server or Cosmos DB).

Day 10: Data Management in Microservices
Learn about database per service pattern, and how to manage data in microservices.
Practice: Set up a database for your microservice.

Day 11: Communication Between Microservices
Understand synchronous vs. asynchronous communication and when to use each.
Resource: Learn about message brokers (RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, etc.)

Day 12: Implementing Service Communication
Implement service-to-service communication in your microservice using HTTP and/or messaging.
Practice: Modify your product service to communicate with a new inventory service.

Day 13: Authentication and Authorization
Learn about securing microservices with OAuth2 and JWT.
Resource: Explore Azure Active Directory for managed authentication.

Day 14: Tech Deep-Dive
Go deeper into either Azure Functions or Azure API Management.
Practice: Set up an API in Azure API Management.

#Week 3: Containerization and Orchestration

Day 15: Introduction to Docker
Learn what Docker is and how to create Docker containers.
Practice: Containerize your microservice using a Dockerfile.

Day 16: Docker Compose
Learn about Docker Compose and how to manage multi-container applications.
Practice: Create a docker-compose.yml for your microservices.

Day 17: Introduction to Kubernetes
Understand Kubernetes architecture and core concepts.
Resource: Kelsey Hightower's "Kubernetes the Hard Way".

Day 18: Deploying to AKS
Learn how to deploy your containerized microservices to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Practice: Create an AKS cluster and deploy your microservices.

Day 19: Service Discovery and Load Balancing
Learn how Azure Kubernetes Service handles service discovery and load balancing.
Resource: Azure Kubernetes Services documentation.

Day 20: Monitoring and Logging
Understand how to monitor your microservices (Azure Monitor, Application Insights).
Practice: Set up monitoring for your deployed services.

Day 21: Finishing Touches
Review what you’ve learned. Refactor your services based on best practices you’ve discovered.

#Week 4: Advanced Topics and Best Practices

Day 22: API Gateway Patterns
Learn about API Gateway patterns and implementations (using Azure API Management).
Practice: Set up an API Gateway for your microservices.

Day 23: Circuit Breaker and Retry Patterns
Learn about circuit breaker and retry patterns for resilience in microservices.
Resource: Polly library for .NET.

Day 24: Event-Driven Architecture
Understand event-driven architecture with Azure Event Grid or Azure Event Hubs.
Practice: Implement an event-driven pattern in your services.

Day 25: CI/CD for Microservices
Learn about Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines.
Resource: Explore Azure DevOps Services.

Day 26: Setting Up CI/CD in Azure
Create a CI/CD pipeline for your microservice using Azure DevOps.
Practice: Automate deployment to your AKS cluster.

Day 27: Security Best Practices
Understand security considerations and best practices for microservices.
Resource: Azure Security Best Practices.

Day 28: Review and Final Project
Spend this day reviewing everything you’ve learned and selecting a significant project or improvement to implement, potentially involving all the skills you've acquired.
Ongoing: Join Communities and Continue Learning

#Join Forums/Communities: 
Engage with communities on Stack Overflow, Reddit, or GitHub.
#Follow Blogs and Channels: 
Subscribe to relevant blogs, YouTube channels, or newsletters about microservices and Azure.
#Attend Workshops/Webinars: 
Keep an eye out for online workshops or webinars related to microservices and Azure.

#Practice Projects
As you progress, think about building small projects or contributing to open-source projects. Some ideas include:
Building an e-commerce platform with different microservices (Product Service, Order Service, etc.)
Creating a simple To-Do list application where microservices handle different functionalities.
